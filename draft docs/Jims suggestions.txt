interesting ot try and get rid of features being correlated with each other
try PCA (dim reduction)
feature creation
could try other things maybe age distribution, % above a certain ages
average,median
e.g. above or below weighted average age

just keep going here - this is OK work for the class.

add data at zip code levle too perhaps
population
bring in inpaitent healthcare pricing as well.
